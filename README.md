# Intel DPT model usage

#### ====================

####

#### This is a simple example of how to use the Intel DPT model

####

#### The model is a 3D convolutional neural network that takes as input a

#### 3D volume of size 128x128x128 and outputs a 3D volume of size 128x128x128

####

#### The model is trained on the [DPT dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/dpt#dpt)

#### and is available in the [Hugging Face model hub](https://huggingface.co/intel/dpt-large-patch16-384)
